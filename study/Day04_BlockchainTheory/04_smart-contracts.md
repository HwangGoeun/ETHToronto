# Smart Contracts

<br>

## 1. What is a Smart Contract?

### A **`self-executing program`** stored on the blockchain that runs when predefined conditions are met.

- No need for intermediaries (like banks or lawyers).
- Runs **automatically** and **transparently**.
- Written in **Solidity** (for Ethereum).

## 2. Key Features of Smart Contracts

| Feature           | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Autonomous**    | Executes without human intervention                     |
| **Immutable**     | Cannot be changed once deployed                          |
| **Transparent**   | Code and results are visible to everyone on the blockchain |
| **Trustless**     | No need to trust any third party                         |

## 3. Example Use Cases

| Use Case           | Description                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Token creation** | ERC-20, ERC-721 (NFTs)                     |
| **Voting systems** | Transparent, tamper-proof elections        |
| **Escrow services**| Funds released only when conditions are met|
| **Decentralized finance (DeFi)** | Lending, borrowing, exchanges |

## 4. Smart Contract Lifecycle

1. **Write**: Code the contract in Solidity.
2. **Compile**: Turn the code into bytecode (understood by the EVM).
3. **Deploy**: Upload the contract to the blockchain (creates a contract address).
4. **Interact**: Call the contract's functions to execute logic.

## 5. Limitations of Smart Contracts

| Limitation           | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **No external data** | Cannot access data outside the blockchain without oracles |
| **Immutability**     | Bugs cannot be fixed after deployment                      |
| **Gas costs**        | Complex contracts can be expensive to execute              |

## 6. Ethereum and Smart Contracts

- Ethereum is the **largest platform for smart contracts**.
- Uses **Solidity** as the main programming language.
- Smart contracts can hold **ETH and interact with other contracts**.
