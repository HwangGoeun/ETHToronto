# 💾 Reflection
I have studied the basic theory of blockchain.
Although I had heard the term blockchain before, I didn’t fully understand what it actually was.
After learning the core concepts, I started thinking more deeply about the advantages and disadvantages of decentralization.

While studying consensus algorithms, I encountered the term `block creation rights`.
One of the reasons why these rights are necessary is to identify who should receive rewards.
I learned that without rewards, it would be difficult to sustain the network, and that rewards act as the fuel for running a decentralized ecosystem.

However, this raised a question for me:
If decentralization means utilizing the resources of many different computers,
is it really more efficient in terms of energy consumption compared to centralized systems?

I understood that the chain structure of blockchain provides strong security,
but when I looked at algorithms like `Proof of Stake`,
where those with more stake (tokens) hold greater authority over block creation,
I started to wonder,
“Is this truly decentralized?”

Of course, I believe I need to study this part further to understand it better.
But this learning process has definitely made me question and explore more about how decentralization works in reality.
